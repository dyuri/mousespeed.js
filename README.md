MouseSpeed.js
=============

A more UX friendly way to activate widgets on mouse over than the simple "mouseover" event is to check the speed of the mouse movement. If the mouse cursor is quick, then most probably the user does not want to hover over the widget, but its only in the way of the mouse, but if the cursor is slow, then it's more likely that the user wants to iteract with the given widget.

Check demo.html, try to move the mouse over the yellow and the green box, quickly and slowly to notice the difference.
